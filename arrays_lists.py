"""
1. Lists in python
-> built in data structure
-> Can store different datatypes
-> Dynamically resizable
-> slower for numerical operations compared to arrays

2. Arrays in python 
-> Provided the Array module or Numpy for better performance
-> All elements must be the same type
-> More memory-efficient than lists
-> Faster for numerical operations
